# 🐟 no-as-a-fish-function 🐠

**no-as-a-fish-function** is a quirky little Fish shell 🐚 function that delivers a random rejection reason every time you type `no`. Whether you're dodging work, turning down a meeting, or just need a dramatic excuse to say *nope*, this function has your back — with style.

> Inspired by the delightfully cheeky [No-as-a-Service](https://github.com/hotheadhacker/no-as-a-service) by [hotheadhacker](https://github.com/hotheadhacker) 🙌.

## 📦 Installation

To install:

1. Download the function and reason files.
2. Move it into your Fish functions directory:

   ```
   mv no.fish noreasons.json ~/.config/fish/functions
   ```

That’s it — no hoops, no hassle. 🎯

## 🧪 Usage

Once installed, just open your Fish shell and type:

```
no
```

You’ll get a random, realistic (or ridiculous) reason to say no. Great for scripts, social coding, or just making your terminal a little sassier. 😎

Examples:
- 🚫 *Negative. Full stop.*
- ❌ *The last time I tried, I got a papercut on my soul.*
- 🙅 *If I help you, I'll feel obligated to help others, and that's a slippery slope I'm avoiding.*

## 🎨 Why?

Because sometimes you just need to say **no** — and it's way more fun with flair.

Whether you're building a mock API, pranking a friend, or staying on brand as the local pessimist, `no-as-a-fish-function` lets you turn people down with charm, sass, or passive-aggressive precision.
